          Your antivirus may block the installer. To allow the Lock and Open installer, open your antivirus, find the quarantine section, and follow the instructions for antivirus other than Windows Defender. <a href="https://www.google.com">Click here!</a>

      <h4>Why This Happens</h4>
      <p className="guide-paragraph">
        Since we currently cannot afford a formal code signing certificate, some
        systems may flag our software as unrecognized. Rest assured, we are
        actively working towards obtaining a certificate to eliminate these
        warnings in the future.
